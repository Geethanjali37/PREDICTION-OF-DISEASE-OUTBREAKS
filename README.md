https://nvs4thmv67633kwhmjmsxu.streamlit.app/

This project is a machine learning-based disease prediction system built using Streamlit for the user interface. It helps users predict the likelihood of having Diabetes, Heart Disease, or Parkinson’s Disease based on input medical parameters.

Features ✨

🔹 Predicts three diseases:

Diabetes 🩸

Heart Disease ❤️

Parkinson’s Disease 🧠


🔹 User-Friendly UI: Built using Streamlit, making it interactive and easy to use.

🔹 Pre-Trained ML Models: Uses machine learning models trained on medical datasets for accurate predictions.

🔹 Fast & Efficient: Models are loaded once and cached for better performance.

🔹 Easy Input Fields: Users can enter medical parameters via form fields to get instant results.

Tech Stack 🛠

🔹 Frontend: Streamlit (for UI)

🔹 Backend: Python

🔹 Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas

🔹 Model Storage: Pickle (.sav files)

How It Works? 🏥

1️⃣ Choose a disease to predict (Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s).

2️⃣ Enter the required medical parameters using the UI.

3️⃣ Click the prediction button to get instant results.

4️⃣ The model processes the input and returns a prediction (Positive/Negative).
